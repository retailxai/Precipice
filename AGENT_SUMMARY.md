# RetailXAI Agent Framework - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive agent framework for the RetailXAI system that significantly extends its capabilities for data collection, processing, and publishing. The framework follows a modular, scalable architecture with proper error handling, monitoring, and configuration management.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Core Framework Architecture

- **BaseAgent Class**: Created a robust base class that all agents inherit from, providing:
  - Configuration management
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff  
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Status tracking and monitoring
  - Standardized result format

- **AgentManager**: Implemented a central orchestrator that provides:
  - Agent lifecycle management
  - Pipeline execution (data collection → processing → publishing)
  - Status monitoring and execution history
  - Configuration loading from YAML files
  - Parallel execution capabilities

### 2. Data Collection Agents (4 agents)

#### LinkedInAgent
- Collects posts from company LinkedIn pages
- Supports LinkedIn API integration
- Converts posts to standardized Transcript entities

#### NewsAPIAgent  
- Collects news articles about companies from News API
- Filters articles by relevance and length
- Converts articles to Transcript entities

#### RedditAgent
- Collects Reddit posts mentioning companies
- Searches across configurable subreddits
- Handles multiple subreddits and search queries

#### EarningsAgent
- Specialized agent for earnings calls and financial documents
- Can work with SEC filings and earnings call sites
- Provides sample earnings data for testing

### 3. Processing Agents (3 agents)

#### SentimentAgent
- Analyzes sentiment in collected content
- Supports both TextBlob and Claude API for analysis
- Includes fallback simple sentiment analysis
- Extracts key phrases with sentiment scores

#### CompetitorAgent
- Analyzes competitive landscape and competitor mentions
- Detects competitor mentions with context extraction
- Determines competitive positioning (offensive/defensive/neutral)
- Identifies competitive themes

#### TrendAgent
- Identifies and analyzes market trends
- Supports predefined trend categories (technology, sustainability, etc.)
- Detects emerging trends through frequency analysis
- Aggregates trends across multiple sources

### 4. Publishing Agents (2 agents)

#### LinkedInPublisher
- Publishes content to LinkedIn company pages
- Supports draft mode for review before publishing
- Handles character limits and formatting
- Integrates hashtags automatically

#### SlackAgent
- Sends notifications and reports to Slack
- Supports multiple notification types (daily summary, alerts, trends)
- Rich message formatting with blocks and attachments
- Works with both webhooks and bot tokens

### 5. Configuration System

- **agents.yaml**: Comprehensive configuration file for all agents
- **Environment variables**: Secure API key management
- **Pipeline configuration**: Execution order and data flow settings
- **Agent-specific settings**: Timeouts, retries, intervals

### 6. Testing and Validation

- **Simple test script**: Validates core functionality without external dependencies
- **Comprehensive test script**: Full testing with all dependencies
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Handles missing optional dependencies
- **All tests passing**: ✓ 6/6 tests successful

## Key Features

### Scalability
- Parallel execution of agents within each pipeline stage
- Configurable timeouts and retry logic
- Memory-efficient data processing
- Modular architecture for easy extension

### Reliability  
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful shutdown capabilities
- Configuration validation
- Status monitoring and execution history

### Flexibility
- Easy to add new agents by extending BaseAgent
- Configurable through YAML files
- Optional dependencies with fallbacks
- Multiple execution modes (individual, pipeline, full)

### Integration
- Seamless integration with existing RetailXAI system
- Uses existing entity models (Company, Transcript, etc.)
- Compatible with current database and logging systems
- Can be integrated into existing scheduler

## Dependencies Added

```
aiohttp==3.9.1          # Async HTTP client
praw==7.7.1             # Reddit API (optional)
textblob==0.17.1        # Sentiment analysis (optional)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Execution
```python
from agent_manager import AgentManager

# Initialize manager
manager = AgentManager("config/agents.yaml")

# Execute single agent
result = await manager.execute_agent('sentiment_analyzer')

# Execute full pipeline
pipeline_result = await manager.execute_full_pipeline()
```

### Creating Custom Agents
```python
from agents.base_agent import BaseAgent, AgentConfig, AgentResult

class CustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    def validate_config(self) -> bool:
        return True
    
    async def execute(self) -> AgentResult:
        # Agent implementation
        return AgentResult(self.config.name, True, data)
```

## Configuration Example

```yaml
agents:
  sentiment_analyzer:
    enabled: true
    max_retries: 2
    timeout_seconds: 30
    config:
      use_claude: false
      
  linkedin_publisher:
    enabled: false
    config:
      access_token: ${LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN}
      draft_mode: true
```
